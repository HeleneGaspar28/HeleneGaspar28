## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**HeleneGaspar28/HeleneGaspar28** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a builder with a background in B2B sales, growth, and product.

At Velopass, I was the first hire. I scaled it from zero to 1,500+ B2B customers in 3 countries and drove â‚¬300K ARR. I led go-to-market, closed partnerships, and worked closely with engineers to shape the product.

I then learned to code at Le Wagon (Rails, JavaScript, PostgreSQL) to go deeper into product and engineering.

I like working on products that solve real customer problems. Looking to join a high-growth startup where I can contribute across product, growth, and engineering.
